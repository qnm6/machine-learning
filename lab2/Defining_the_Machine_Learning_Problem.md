1. Is this a regression, classification, or clustering problem?

This dataset is used for a classification problem. That’s because we’re not predicting a number—we’re choosing between different categories that describe how acceptable a car is.

2. Is there a target variable?

Yes, there is a target variable.
It represents the overall evaluation of the car, such as whether the car is unacceptable, acceptable, good, or very good. This is the value the model is trying to figure out.

3. What is the model expected to learn or predict?

The model is expected to learn how different car features affect its acceptability.
Based on things like the price, safety level, number of doors, passenger capacity, and luggage size, the model predicts which category the car belongs to.
